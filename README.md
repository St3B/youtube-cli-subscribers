# youtube-cli-subscribers
this simple program allows you to monitor a certain youtube channel's subcribers, using google's API key. 

# execution
to run this program you'll need PHP 5.6, and a terminal. Currently not implemented in an HTML page but hey that's my first commit here. In your terminal type:
``php main.php``
and you'll be asked for your API key. You can ask for one at https://console.developers.google.com/apis/dashboard.

#features:
